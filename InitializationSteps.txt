pip install mysqlclient-1.4.6-cp39-cp39-win32.whl    (this file is something you have to download yourself, make sure you find the right one for your OS)
(This might also not be necessary, try to install flask_mysqldb first and if that doesn't work do this)
FOR MAC: try installing 

pip install flask_mysqldb

pip install pyyaml
